# Mini Projects to Master Crane and Crane-Lib

To understand the **Crane CLI** (from [https://github.com/migtools/crane](https://github.com/migtools/crane), a tool for migrating Kubernetes workloads and state between clusters) and **Crane-Lib** (from [https://github.com/konveyor/crane-lib](https://github.com/konveyor/crane-lib), a Go library handling transformations and state transfers), Here are two simple migration projects:

---

## 1. Basic Stateless Pod Migration

**Setup:** Set up two local Kubernetes clusters (using Minikube or Kind). Deploy a simple Nginx pod in the source cluster. Use Crane to export the resources, transform them (e.g., for namespace changes), and apply to the destination. Run: `crane export -n default`, `crane transform`, `crane apply`.

**What you'll learn:** Core CLI workflow (export-transform-apply pipeline), basic manifest handling, and non-destructive operations. Reference the guestbook example in the Crane repo for guidance.

---

## 2. Migrating a Deployment with Services

**Setup:** Deploy a sample guestbook app (Redis + frontend) as a Deployment and Service in one cluster. Migrate it using Crane, focusing on how services and endpoints are preserved during transformation. Test connectivity post-migration.

**What you'll learn:** Handling multi-resource apps, understanding service and endpoint preservation during migration, and basic Crane CLI workflow for Kubernetes resource transformations.

Note: This project is AI assisted by Grok and Cursor Auto mode. All the code was generated by these tool and was reviwed and tested by me. All my learning are documented in other markdown files with help from Cursor.
